# Day 1: Intro to Geospatial Data and Mapping

Day 1 will introduce key ideas and critical methods in cartography and geographic information science, and, discuss how maps, as spatial representations, function in digital scholarship and humanities research. We will also talk about spatial data wrangling—or, how to find, download, and properly format data for use in various spatial visualization platforms. Finally, we will provide a project design worksheet to structure your learning throughout the week.
