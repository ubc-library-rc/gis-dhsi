# Day 3: Web Mapping

Day 3 will concern web mapping, that is, making dynamic, interactive maps that are hosted on the web and can be shared to others via a link. Although web mapping can be done entirely within an online graphical user interface without any coding necessary, in order to understand how web maps work, we will break down their anatomy in a code editor. Then, you'll have a chance to experiment with different web mapping technologies including uMap, Google MyMaps, Leaflet, and a QGIS plugin for web mapping. 

- Understand the anatomy of a web map, that is, the various components that work together to power an interactive and dynamic map hosted on the web;
- Become familiar with the different tools and platforms available for web mapping, including the advantages and disadvantages of each; and
- Be equipped with the fundamental knowledge and skills to begin web mapping on their own.


## Lesson Plan 
**Morning Session** 
- Outline web options, such as uMap and Google Mymaps
- Leaflet - tinker with boilerplate map

**Afternoon Session**
- qgis2plugin (webmapifying a pre-made qgis project )
-  hosting with github (make sure there's time for that)



## In preparation 
- VS code
