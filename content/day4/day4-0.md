# Day 4: Storymaps

Description

On day 4 we will work with historical maps and multi-media narratives. Multi-media narratives combine text, maps, videos, timelines, and more to convey your spatial information in the form of an interactive story. You will learn how to georeference digitized maps using IIIF and QGIS, and explore the capabilities of ArcGIS StoryMaps (the free version) and Knightlab StoryMaps, a free and open-source alternative for narrative mapping. As with all other tools introduced throughout our course, we will discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of each platform, and show you how to get started in both.
