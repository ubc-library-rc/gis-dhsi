# Spatial Visualization in/for Digital Humanities Research



This course is a gentle introduction to mapping and spatial visualization for storytelling in the digital humanities. Rather than focusing on a particular software or technical workflow, we will introduce a variety of mapping tools while evaluating respective affordances and limitations. Short lectures and demonstrations will be paired with hands-on exercises and collaborative problem solving, as well as discussions of emerging research areas in cartography and digital mapping. By the end of this course, participants will be aware of the breadth of maps and spatial visualizations possible in digital humanities work, understand their applicability, and have practical experience making them. The pacing and structure of this course is geared towards an audience of geospatial novices to intermediate mappers. While this course will involve some basic coding, no previous coding experience is required.

The goal of our course is to help you understand different spatial visualization and mapping techniques and identify which might be appropriate for your project needs
Throughout the week we will think about what it means to approach research spatially and what practical steps you need to take to do so.
We will Introduce you to a variety of tools (with various levels of difficulty) to implement your projects. THese include: 
- GIS
- Webmapping
- Narrative Mapping Tools

We will also scaffold our week some project planning fundamentals to help make sure you leave the week with a project plan to move forward
You do not need any technical skills coming into this workshop - just a sense of curiosity about how you can explore space through your work!
